    "using **variables** that take on the values `True` or\n",
    "`False` and the operators AND (conjunction, denoted by\n",
    "$\\wedge$), OR (disjunction, denoted by $\\vee$), and negation (denoted\n",
    "by $\\neg$).  \n",
    "\n",
    "We need a few more definitions:\n",
    "* A **literal** is either a variable (a positive literal), or the\n",
    "negation of a variable (a negative literal). \n",
    "* A **clause** is a disjunction of literals or a single literal.\n",
    "* A formula is in **conjunctive normal form** (CNF) if it is a conjunction of clauses or a single clause.\n",

    "For example, the formula $(x_1 \\vee x_3) \\wedge (x_2 \\vee \\neg x_3\n",
    "\\vee x_4) \\wedge (\\neg x_1 \\vee x_2 \\vee \\neg x_4)$ is in CNF.\n",
    "The formulas we will use in this assignment all have 3 literals per\n",

    "\n",
    "The **satisfiability problem (SAT)** is the problem of finding whether there is\n",

    "This problem is known to be NP-complete.\n",
    "We'll consider a more general variant of the problem, which is [MAXSAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_satisfiability_problem): given a formula in CNF, find an\n",

    "* Then the clauses follow. Each clause is a sequence of distinct non-null numbers between `-nbvar` and `nbvar` ending with a 0 (the 0 does not refer to any variable); it cannot contain the opposite literals i and -i simultaneously. A positive number denotes the corresponding variable. A negative number denotes the negation of the corresponding variable.\n",
